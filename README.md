**DevJam Project - Expense Tracker**

## Introduction  
We tried to make an expense tracker website where you can add your daily expense according to a category and it well be stored in a table. We also tried to store the data of the user under monthly and weekly basis according to different categories, but we could not accomplish it due to incomplete knowledge of backend.
